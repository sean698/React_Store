## Description

This project is a mockup online store. <br/>
Development: ```npm run dev ``` && ```nodemon server.js``` <br/>
Production: Visit https://react-store-wine.vercel.app/ <br/>

**PS: There might be some issues when you try cart function and edit inventory function in the production development, because I use the json-server as my server, and the writing operation on the platform that I deployed on is not allowed. The code is totally fine.**
